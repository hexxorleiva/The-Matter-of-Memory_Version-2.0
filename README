This project was created to allow anyone with a mobile phone to record a moment within a 
location and have that be available to anyone else running that application. The recording 
can only be accessed if you are running the application and then are within 100 feet of the 
recording site.

This is an Art project based on the investigations by Hector Leiva on how GPS and information
systems create more complex relationships between human beings and the history of space and time.
